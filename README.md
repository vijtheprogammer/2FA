Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) System
This Python script provides a simple implementation of a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system. It utilizes the pyotp library to generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) and the qrcode library to create QR codes for easy setup with authentication apps.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have installed the pyotp library using pip:
- pip3 install pyotp
- pip3 install qrcode

1. Generate a Secret Key

Upon running the script, a random secret key will be generated. This key is essential for generating OTPs.
Note: Keep this key secure. It should only be accessible to the service provider. Sharing this key can compromise the security of the 2FA system.

2. Generate QR Code

The script will create a QR code containing the provisioning URI for setting up the OTP generator in authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or similar.
Scan this QR code with your authentication app to add the service to your 2FA setup.

3. Enter OTP

After setting up the authentication app, the script will prompt you to enter the one-time passcode generated by the app.
Enter the OTP displayed in your authentication app when prompted by the script.

4. Verification

The script will continuously prompt for OTP verification until a correct OTP is entered.
If the OTP is correct, it will return True; otherwise, it will return False.

**Note**

This script is designed for educational purposes and should be used with caution in production environments.
Ensure that the generated secret key is kept confidential and only accessible to authorized personnel. Sharing the secret key can lead to security vulnerabilities.
For enhanced security, consider implementing additional measures such as rate-limiting, IP whitelisting, or using hardware tokens.
